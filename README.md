My name is Joseph Maina, a graduating LLB student in Kenya.
I am currently learning everything I can in programming including HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, and front-end and back-end development.
My main goal is to be able to apply these skills in making strides towards solving modern-day problems such as climate change among more.
As an LLB student, I would like to apply these skills in providing better and more efficient services in my future career.
