My name is Joseph Maina, a graduating LLB student in Kenya.
I am currently learning everything I can in programming including HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, and front-end and back-end development.
My main goal is to apply these skills and make progress toward solving modern-day problems, such as climate change.
As an LLB student, I would also like to apply these skills to provide better and more efficient services in my future career.
